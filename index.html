    <h2> Issues with the Current Design </h2>
    <p> Confusing with the G and V button. 
        This is bad for users who do not know specifically what G and V mean. One can assume that G means ground, but V is not easy to interpret when stepping into an elevator. Because of this, the design with buttons “G” and “V” are not a great design.

        \n Some feedback lights are dim when pressed.
        When the feedback lights do not work, it is hard for a user to interpret if the machine receives the instruction. If the feedback light does light up, users are informed that the elevator understands the task and will bring the users to the floor that they requested. Because user feedback is provided, it is a good thing, but, since the lights are not bright enough to recognize that feedback has issued, the interface is slightly flawed. 

        \n Confusion with multiple open/closed buttons (it's for two sides but can be misleading)
        This is a bad design feature as the users probably understand what the buttons do, but they do not know why there are two sets of them. To limit the misunderstanding, one set of buttons to open and close either door will solve the problem as one door is only open when users enter/exit the elevator.

    <h2> Common and Rare Uses of an Elevator</h2>
    <p>Common Uses: Level Buttons - Most commonly used to request which floor you would like to go to <br>
       Open / Close Door - Only used after floor selection
      
       Rare Uses: Alarm - Used in case of an emergency
       Help Button - Used for assistance in the elevator

    </p>
    
    
    <h2> Does the interface make doing the common things easier</h2>
    <p>Yes, the interface does make the common things easier as the interface is simple and easy to navigate. With the buttons positioned vertically to symbolize the level of the floors and the feedback on the button click, the interface is fairly easy to use and makes it fairly straightforward to operate.

    </p>
    
    <h2> Common Sequence of Actions </h2>
    <p>
      1. Press the button which corresponds to the level which you wish to go to.
      2. Press the close door button if necessary.
      3. Travel to the floor you chose.
      4. Press the open door button if desired.
      5. Exit elevator.
    </p>
    
    <h2> How does the elevator support the user to figure it out? </h2>
    <p>
      The elevator supports the user to figure it out by providing: <br>
        - Braille <br>
        - Symbols <br>
        - Numbers <br>
      
      on the interface
