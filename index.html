    <h2> Issues with the Current Design </h2>
    <p> Confusing with the G and V button. 
        This is bad for users who do not know specifically what G and V mean. One can assume that G means ground, but V is not easy to interpret when stepping into an elevator. Because of this, the design with buttons “G” and “V” are not a great design.

        \n Some feedback lights are dim when pressed.
        When the feedback lights do not work, it is hard for a user to interpret if the machine receives the instruction. If the feedback light does light up, users are informed that the elevator understands the task and will bring the users to the floor that they requested. Because user feedback is provided, it is a good thing, but, since the lights are not bright enough to recognize that feedback has issued, the interface is slightly flawed. 

        \n Confusion with multiple open/closed buttons (it's for two sides but can be misleading)
        This is a bad design feature as the users probably understand what the buttons do, but they do not know why there are two sets of them. To limit the misunderstanding, one set of buttons to open and close either door will solve the problem as one door is only open when users enter/exit the elevator.

    <h2> Common and Rare Uses of an Elevator</h2>
    <p>Common Uses: Level Buttons - Most commonly used to request which floor you would like to go to <br>
       Open / Close Door - Only used after floor selection
      
       Rare Uses: Alarm - Used in case of an emergency
       Help Button - Used for assistance in the elevator

    </p>
    
    
    <h2> Does the Interface make doing the Common things Easier? </h2>
    <p>Yes, the interface does make the common things easier as the interface is simple and easy to navigate. With the buttons positioned vertically to symbolize the level of the floors and the feedback on the button click, the interface is fairly easy to use and makes it fairly straightforward to operate.

    </p>
    
    <h2> Common Sequence of Actions </h2>
    <p>
      1. Press the button which corresponds to the level which you wish to go to.
      2. Press the close door button if necessary.
      3. Travel to the floor you chose.
      4. Press the open door button if desired.
      5. Exit elevator.
    </p>
    
    <h2> How does the Elevator Support the User to Figure it out? </h2>
    <p>
      The elevator supports the user to figure it out by providing: <br>
        - Braille <br>
        - Symbols <br>
        - Numbers <br>
      
      On the Interface
    </p>
    
    <h2> How does the Elevator provide Feedback to the User </h2>
    <p>
      The elevator provides feedback to the user by making the button in which the user pushed, light up, indicating that that is the floor chosen/confirmed. Also, pressing the button in itself provides feedback with the “click/push inward” of the button.
    </p>
    
    <h2> What are some Common Mistakes you can make with this Current Design? </h2>
    <p>
      Open and close buttons can be misleading so you could press the wrong set of open/close buttons depending on which door you would like to open. <br>
      G and V can be misinterpreted for different levels.
    </p>
    
    <h2> My Suggestions to Improve the Control Interface </h2>
    <p>
      Make G and V more understandable because people can be confused on what these letters mean. To justify this, I am changing G and V to G and B to show that G means ground floor and B means basement.

      Signify which are the “front” and “back” doors on the elevator or just have one set of open and close door symbols. To justify this, I am only using one set of open and closed door buttons. As users walk into an elevator, only one set of doors is opened at the time. With this being said, only one door will need to be closed. 

      Clean up the button layout: Although the buttons on the original interface are easy to use and self explanatory, stacking the ground levels vertically and having the alarm, help, and open and close button stacked horizontally below the level buttons will allow for the more common buttons to be accessed while the less used buttons will be organized to a new location.
