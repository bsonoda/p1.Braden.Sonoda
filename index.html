    <h2> Issues with the Current Design </h2>
    <p> Confusing with the G and V button. 
        This is bad for users who do not know specifically what G and V mean. One can assume that G means ground, but V is not easy to interpret when stepping into an elevator. Because of this, the design with buttons “G” and “V” are not a great design

        Some feedback lights are dim when pressed
        When the feedback lights do not work, it is hard for a user to interpret if the machine receives the instruction. If the feedback light does light up, users are informed that the elevator understands the task and will bring the users to the floor that they requested.

        Confusion with multiple open/closed buttons (it's for two sides but can be misleading)
        This is a bad design feature as the users probably understand what the buttons do, but they do not know why there are two sets of them. To limit the misunderstanding, one set of buttons to open and close either door will solve the problem as one door is only open when users enter/exit the elevator.
